# Opening the project workspace
Because this project will contain code for several different micro-projects, we have to use a VSCode Workspace.

Without using a workspace, PlatformIO will not work properly.

To open this project, click ```File->Open Workspace from File ...```

Then select the [iot-project-h2022.code-workspace](iot-project-h2022.code-workspace) file in this git repo folder.
